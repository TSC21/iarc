board.py  -> Program that simulates the arena board and the roombas
          -> init method takes width and height (in meters) of the board, rCount is the regular roomba count, sCount is the spike roomba count
          -> draw() draws the initial state of the board and roombas
          -> collision(pos1, pos2) takes the two positions of roombas and detects collision
          -> run() executes the initial draw and updates roombas as necessary, calling collision() and checking for out-of-bounds roombas
